🌟 Sometimes the best ideas come when you least expect them…
I’d been down with a fever for the past few days, not feeling well at all. But in the middle of resting, a random idea popped into my mind:
 “Why not play with LLMs while I’m stuck at home?”
So I decided to turn this downtime into learning time — and that’s how I ended up building my own local AI chatbot using:
 ✅ FastAPI
 ✅ Ollama + Gemma3
 ✅ Gradio
🤖 What I built
A simple, clean chatbot that:
Uses FastAPI for the backend
Runs Gemma3 locally via Ollama
Streams responses live with FastAPI’s StreamingResponse
Has a Gradio UI for chatting in real time
Keeps session history so the conversation feels natural
All in one Python file — no cloud, no extra servers, no cost.
 Just run:
bash:
uvicorn chatbot_api:app --reload
…and chat with your LLM at http://127.0.0.1:8000/gradio.
💡 Why this is exciting
I love how accessible local LLMs are becoming — you don’t need a huge setup to experiment and learn. Even when you’re not at your best, you can still build something meaningful.
This small project reminded me:
Learning never stops — even when you’re under the weather.
If anyone’s curious about the full code or wants help setting up their own local LLM playground, I’m happy to share! Just comment “🔗” below.
